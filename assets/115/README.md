## Description:

This huge non-symmetrical map provides a beautiful and detailed landscape and uses the offset, so the end of the playing area doesn't corresponds to the end of the map.

- For 6 players +1 extra advanced base in the middle (for a bot for example) +1 scavenger base.

- Total size : 250x250, playable : 200x200.

- 4 oil in each base +in avearge 60 on the rest of the map.

- Some lakes and a lot of mountains.

- Playable with or without VTOLs.

- The gateways are all placed in the strategic points, so the bots are not disavantaged.

- Tileset : Arizona.
