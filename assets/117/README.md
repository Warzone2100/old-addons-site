## Description:

A 3x3 map with custom textures known as "the marble tileset".

It's a team battle map with slightly more than 6 oils per player and very few key chokepoints for better teamwork.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
