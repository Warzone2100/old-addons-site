## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

My newest map is called Faces, because if you will look carefully you will see four faces  and they seem not to be very happy  

The map is 180 x 180, for four players, 18 oils per player, 9 in base, but spread, and another 9 around the map. Advanced bases included.

Each island is surrounded by cliffs what helps to protect them, hover technology can be a good advantage.

The map is so designed that most of the land is below sea level to make it look interesting.

Have fun
