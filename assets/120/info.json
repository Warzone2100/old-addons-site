    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nMy newest map is called Faces, because if you will look carefully you will see four faces  and they seem not to be very happy  \n\nThe map is 180 x 180, for four players, 18 oils per player, 9 in base, but spread, and another 9 around the map. Advanced bases included.\n\nEach island is surrounded by cliffs what helps to protect them, hover technology can be a good advantage.\n\nThe map is so designed that most of the land is below sea level to make it look interesting.\n\nHave fun  \n",
