    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nI have created NTW Path because when I finished NTW Canyon I couldnâ€™t stop myself from narrowing the NTW the other way  \n\nIt is a path near the NTW Castle where entire NTW Court is settled down  \n\nThe path is extremely narrow so again the NTW features are at least a little bit changed.\n\nThe map is 250x80, for eight players, 30 oils in base, advanced bases are included.\n\nI have put not many defences in from of each base to make you to decide how will you protect your own base. It seems to be very easy to protect so narrow entrances but remember to make the entrances passable enough for appropriate military actions. You can always (very often it is even advisable) that you will cooperate with the other players to make appropriate defences.\n\nThe oil at the back of the base is so placed that he makes no traffic for trucks handling with it.\n\nHave fun gentlemen  \n\nThe narrower the path the greater the tense  \n",
