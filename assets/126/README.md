## Description:

*INSTALL TO MODS AUTOLOAD* 

*then choose the challenge* 

A single player challenge with custom various AIs: one computer ally and three enemies. Originally designed as a demonstration of different capabilities of NullBot, it is a hard challenge for strong players, with quite a lot of surprises to make sure you never let your guard down till the very end.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
