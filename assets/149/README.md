## Description:

A mod that makes you play as scavengers in skirmish games. You build scavenger structures and produce scavenger vehicles.

To play skirmish games choose NullBot ~Mini~ as your opponent (supplied with the mod); other AIs will not work.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
