    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nI have made.. another NTW map.. dont hate me please  \n\nThe map is called Siren, because in those water between opposite set bases the siren lives  The King and Queen know about her but she is harmless so she can live in the waters near the castle freely  \n\nThe map is 200 x 200, for 8 players, 40 oils in base, advanced bases included.\n\nAs you can see to get to the enemy and finish the game hovers or vtols are needed.\n\nThe three strips of land between the bases are allow to built some more defences or structures.\n\nHave fun  \n",
