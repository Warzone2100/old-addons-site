    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nAfter a long struggle and some unexpected events I managed to create another map  \n\nIt is called claws because of the four claws that are clearly visible on the map preview.\n\nThe map is for four players, it supports hovers strongly but is so designed that ground units will travel to the main bases without any problems, well theoretically  The claws protect each main base, it might be well fortified, but there is still this water gap where hovers may enter, but the gap is possible to be protected too  \n\nThere is 6 oils in main base, and another 16 around the map including the isles. Advanced bases included.\n\nHave fun gentlemen  \n",
