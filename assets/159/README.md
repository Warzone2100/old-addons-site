## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

The main aim of this map was simplicity  it is extremely rush friendly.. but do not always have to be.

It is called Tall Grass because there is a lot of grass on it.

The map is for eight players, eight oils in base and another twelve around the map. No advanced bases this time ! It is you who will decide how to organize within your valleys.

The map is extremely open, but there was no such open map by me for almost a year so it is no crime.

The map is open but you will find quite a lot trees on it  

Have fun
