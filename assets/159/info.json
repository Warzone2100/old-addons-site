    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nThe main aim of this map was simplicity  it is extremely rush friendly.. but do not always have to be.\n\nIt is called Tall Grass because there is a lot of grass on it.\n\nThe map is for eight players, eight oils in base and another twelve around the map. No advanced bases this time ! It is you who will decide how to organize within your valleys.\n\nThe map is extremely open, but there was no such open map by me for almost a year so it is no crime.\n\nThe map is open but you will find quite a lot trees on it  \n\nHave fun  \n",
