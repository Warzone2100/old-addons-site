## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

I am happy to present my new two players map  I dont have many of two players maps so I decided to react  

The map is called Lake because it has one big lake on it  

The map is 120 x 80, for two players, 11 oils per player, advanced bases included,

The map is full of hills which should be used wisely  

Have great duels on it  

Bye
