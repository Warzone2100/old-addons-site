    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nThe map is called Death Zone because it is really hard to move around on it freely and without consequences  \n\nThe map is for four players, you have four trucks at the start, and believe me use them wisely  ten oils in base, but by that I mean on the top of the bases cliffs, because there is few more just next to you (practically in base) but the way to it is very long  or at least inconvenient  Generally the rest fifteen of oils is outside of the base, but here the inside/outside case is really difficult to explain due to the maps topography  It is advisable to check all \"mysterious\" places on the map  Advanced bases included  To sum up 25 oils per player  \n\nThe map is again with nice tilesets and the bases are full of features which are there to make them look appropriate  \n\nOn this map I started to play with the grounds levels and this is just the beginning  \n\nDeath Zone is real death zone so think all things through  \n\nHave excellent fun  \n\nBye  \n",
