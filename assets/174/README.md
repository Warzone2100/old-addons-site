## Description:

This package includes a few modified versions of NullBot AI. Unlike the standard NullBot, they all use fixed strategies, instead of randomly choosing their weapons and early build orders.

NullBot "MR" : Focuses on machineguns and rockets. Doesn't use large bodies. Always uses Lab-Factory-Factory-Lab-CC engineering-first build order. Historically, it was the first personality of NullBot ever created.

NullBot "MC": Focuses on machineguns and cannons. It is also the rusher, using the state-of-the-art three-factory rush as its build order.

NullBot "Flame": Focuses on pure flamers. Spams flamer cyborgs until it gets hovers.

It also includes four challenges that make use of the different AI personalities.

NOTE for linux users: make sure physfs package on your system is not the buggy v2.0.2, otherwise some AIs from this mod will not work.

NOTE: Since NullBot "Hover" and NullBot "Turtle" were merged into the base game (since v3.1.1), they are no longer provided with this mod (since v2.07).

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
