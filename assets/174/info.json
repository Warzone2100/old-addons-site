    "description": "This package includes a few modified versions of NullBot AI. Unlike the standard NullBot, they all use fixed strategies, instead of randomly choosing their weapons and early build orders.\n\nNullBot \"MR\" : Focuses on machineguns and rockets. Doesn't use large bodies. Always uses Lab-Factory-Factory-Lab-CC engineering-first build order. Historically, it was the first personality of NullBot ever created.\n\nNullBot \"MC\": Focuses on machineguns and cannons. It is also the rusher, using the state-of-the-art three-factory rush as its build order.\n\nNullBot \"Flame\": Focuses on pure flamers. Spams flamer cyborgs until it gets hovers.\n\nIt also includes four challenges that make use of the different AI personalities.\n\nNOTE for linux users: make sure physfs package on your system is not the buggy v2.0.2, otherwise some AIs from this mod will not work.\n\nNOTE: Since NullBot \"Hover\" and NullBot \"Turtle\" were merged into the base game (since v3.1.1), they are no longer provided with this mod (since v2.07).",
