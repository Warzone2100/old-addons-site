    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \nSome time ago I made few NTW maps  each of it was different and represented a different member of my NTW court  \n\nThere was the queen, the king, the wizard and even prince  now it is time for someone with no royal blood but still irreplaceable on the royal court  \n\nIt is the clown  because a good court has its clown to make them happy in hard times or simply to entertain the royal family  and court members  \n\nThe map is called Clown not without a reason  look carefully do you see those islands behind bases  and those two exactly in the middle of the map  those are the hats of our clown  each of it has three sparks  to explain what I mean I add the picture  below the map picture  \n\nClown is very funny  and he decided to make joke to all players  he put almost all of the oil behind the bases in difficult to protect places  He knows you like to turtle.. so try to turtle now  with almost all oil behind the base in fragile place the rules change a little bit  there is of course second entrance to each base at the back  \n\nThe map is 200 x 200  for eight players  4 oils in base  and 26 \"behind\" each base  in highly difficult to protect place  advanced bases included  \n\nThe map has a lot of nice tilesets  it is the clown who is supposed to be colorful and such is his map  \n\nAround the arena there is one tile shore  smart players will know how to use it wisely  the hats have also enough space to built appropriate defences  both on the hat and its sparks too  so use them wisely  also the hats in the middle of the map at its edges can be great advantage if used wisely  \n\nI think the map is quite nice  \n\nHave fun Gentlemen  \n",
