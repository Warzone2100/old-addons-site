    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nI wanted to make a small experiment by making this map  \n\nThe map is called Tornado because it looks a little bit like tornado seen from birds view  \n\nThe map is so designed that it can be played 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 and also top versus bottom and.. here innovation.. top of the cliffs which is bases 1, 3, 5, 7 versus 0, 2, 4, 6 valley bases  also other combinations are possible  \n\nEspecially when it is 2 v 2 v 2 v 2 or top of the map versus bottom it is important to cooperate between the players on the cliffs and in the valleys  \n\nThe map is a little bit a labyrinth too  \n\nIt is 200 x 200, 4 oils in base and another 11 on the map per player  the map is for 8 players  advanced bases included  \n\nCooperation is crucial here  \n\nBye  \n\nHave fun  \n",
