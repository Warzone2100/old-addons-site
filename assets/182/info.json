    "description": "Hello gentlemen  \n\nThe map is called Chaos because it is in fact at least a little chaotic  \n\nIf you take a closer look you will notice it is made of sixteen identical elements  but.. rotated.. so.. it create a little landscape and terrain chaos  \n\nThe map is for 8 players, advanced bases included, 2 oil in base.. or even 1, it depend on the point of view  and another 8/9 on the map per player  \n\nHave Fun  \n\nBye  \n",
