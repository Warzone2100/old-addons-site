## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

Let me present the War Paths map  one of the more complicated by me  

I called it War Paths because do believe me there will be war on those paths you can see  

The map is 200 x 200  no surprise  for eight players  five oils in base and another ten on the map per player  Advanced bases included  

It can be also used 2 v 2 v 2 v 2  but also FFA and top versus bottom  

Hovers are not necessary to finish the game but may be great advantage  

As always all included, by that I mean nice terrain and features  

Have unbelievable fun  

Cya
