    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nLet me present the War Paths map  one of the more complicated by me  \n\nI called it War Paths because do believe me there will be war on those paths you can see  \n\nThe map is 200 x 200  no surprise  for eight players  five oils in base and another ten on the map per player  Advanced bases included  \n\nIt can be also used 2 v 2 v 2 v 2  but also FFA and top versus bottom  \n\nHovers are not necessary to finish the game but may be great advantage  \n\nAs always all included, by that I mean nice terrain and features  \n\nHave unbelievable fun  \n\nCya  \n",
