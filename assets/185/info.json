    "description": "Hello gentlemen  \n\nI am happy to present another person from the NTW court  Surprisingly it is not the the Knight but the Wizard this time  \n\nThe map is called Wizard because it is entirely made to suit him, all the oval or shall i say circular terrain features are to strengthen his magic ball  As the ball is of course in circular shape it draws energy from all circular places on the map  \n\nNTW Wizard is smaller than Queen and King, it is 200 x 200 as the Wizard knows the more terrain he uses the more power he needs to have.. The Wizard gave post nuclear people advanced bases Including very strong AA system and even Fortresses  \n\nThe map is 26 oil in base, and another 4 per player on the map, in the most energetic places  \n\nThe map is so designed that it could be played even 1 v 7.. and I do know people who will try it  and are able to win  \n\nThe map is NTW but different as I say  This time I wanted.. ekhm.. the Wizard wanted  the players to feel safe in their bases  \n\nThe terrain has nice both features and tilesets  \n\nIt is great fun without bases too !! I do want to inform, that if you see a map with entirely advanced bases, it does not mean you have to use them  or maybe not all the time  \n\nHave fun gentlemen  \n\nGive power to the Wizard !!  \n",
