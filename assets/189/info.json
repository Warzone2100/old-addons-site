    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nThe map is called Revolver because it looks like a revolver of a revolver  I hope you know what I mean  The only difference from original is that its capacity is eight bullets instead of six  bases I mean  \n\nThe map is 200 x 200 and as you can see entirely symmetrical  \n\nThe map is 6 oils in base, and another 9 per player outside of the base  Advanced bases included  The map has 5 villages  4 of which is hidden  and I bet you may figure it out where very soon, to reach it, well a little bit harder it will be   in those 4 hidden villages there is a total amount of 4000 oil in barrels  if you reach them soon enough it may change the gaming fortune into you  \n\nThe map is so designed that it can be easily set into top versus bottom  as I used my usual numering style  as well as FFA  \n\nI have already noticed I went into \"circles\" and \"Arizona\" themes a little bit lately.. I assure I will try to change it with the next map  \n\nHave fun on the Revolver  and remember that ideas are bulletproof !!  \n",
