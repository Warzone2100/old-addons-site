    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nThere is a Queen, so there have to be a King too  \n\nThe NTW King map is almost exactly the same as Queen  but..\n\nEntire centre is as you can easily see filled with circular or shall I say rhombus and square water ponds  \n\nBelieve me this little somehow strategic change, changes the game a lot  \n\nAnother change is within the bases, 10 of oil is on the mainland, but another 30 is on the island behind the bases, this time I do advice to play with no bases, hovers become vital then both on the centre area like for gaining the oil on the islands  If you use advanced bases, and many will do, believe me I know that already  The King is blinded a little.. no sensor towers are in front of the bases as it was with Queen, also you have 6 trucks to start with at one edge of your base  \n\nI decided the advanced bases to stay on the King, as there are always people who are bases thirsty.. without the bases this time, the game gets maybe I think even more interesting  \n\nThere is a Queen, there is a King, well.. a Knight is needed to protect them  and there will be one  and someone else  \n\nHave fun  NTW is NTW I know.. but I want to see it in my way  \n\nBye  \n",
