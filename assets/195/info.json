    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nIt is my third 1 v 1 map  \n\nThe map is 95 x 250  very unusual shape like for all my works  \n\nThe map is 9 oil per player so again very unusual like for me  Advanced bases included  \n\nThere is 4 oil in base per player, the rest is spread around the map  \n\nThe scavengers have nice oil drums surprise if you defeat them  \n\nThe map is called Hell Road, because the most important, at least at the very beginning will be the road  \n\nThe map is nice featured, not very sophisticated maybe but good fun  \n\nHave fun gentlemen  \n\nBye  \n",
