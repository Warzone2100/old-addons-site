## Description:

My old "Vision" map, currently shipped with the game (by the way, originally called "Visionary Mountains" after the song by Manfred Mann that inspired it), remixed for 4 players. Corners are copied "as is", yet the middle is reworked.

A large map for long FFA games. Not very good for 2x2.
