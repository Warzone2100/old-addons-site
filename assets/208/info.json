    "description": "My old \"Vision\" map, currently shipped with the game (by the way, originally called \"Visionary Mountains\" after the song by Manfred Mann that inspired it), remixed for 4 players. Corners are copied \"as is\", yet the middle is reworked.\n\nA large map for long FFA games. Not very good for 2x2.",
