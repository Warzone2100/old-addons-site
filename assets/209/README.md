## Description:

The oldest balanced 5-player map i remember. It used certain terrain hacks that no longer work, so now it's reworked as a map-mod to keep the original looks. Also includes a skybox by aubergine.

A relatively large 5-player FFA map.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
