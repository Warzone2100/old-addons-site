    "description": "Hello Gentlemen :)\n\nAfter a very long pause I have finally created a map which was to warm me up, and I have noticed a lot of warming up I need.\n\nit is called Spaghetti due to the fact that its shape a little bit reminds of its look :)\n\nThe map is for two players. Advanced bases and gateways are included. Ten oils per player. Scavengers.\n\nHave fun :)",
