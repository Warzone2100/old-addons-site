## Description:

Replaces all VTOL propulsions with helicopter propulsions. Uses the original texpages. Helicopters still behave exactly like VTOLs and gameplay is not affected.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
