    "description": "Important: In order to play this map, you must click the * to show all maps as there is no button to view 11 player maps.\n\nAs scavengers are technically a player and 10 player maps can have scavengers, by modifying the scavenger units and structures after map compilation, it is possible to create 11 player maps.\n\nNo bases due to a discontinued effort working on them for this map. The map itself is a huge rotationally symmetrical 249x249 with 12 oils per player in an arizona setting.",
