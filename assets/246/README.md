The 4 bases are at right angles to each other, there is a route around the back of all the bases, there are oil resources in the very corners of the map, the central hill/mountain has been replaced with a lake.

When enabled the scavengers have a presence in the centre and corners of the map and are in possession of 17 oil resources.
