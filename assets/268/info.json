    "description": "Hello Gentlemen,\n\nI believe I dont have to say why it is called Crocodile.\n\nThe bases here have 14x14 tiles areas, so very small. 4 oils per player. Basic structures in minimal amount with two machineguard towers at the gate. I have left some place if 10 player version was needed.\n\nHave fun,\n\nRegards,\n\nMero",
