    "description": "Hello Gentlemen,\n\nThe map is called Bullet because all the eight players are inside the bullet fired from a gun. I also believe that games on this map will be fast as bullets, but who knows.\n\nThe bases are 10x14 tiles, so almost claustrophobic so beware of what and where do you build. Basic structures with two mahinegun towers at the gate. The bullet is really small in general. There is four oils at each base.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it.\n\nRegards,\n\nMero",
