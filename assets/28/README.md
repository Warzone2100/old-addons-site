## Description:

This mod replaces Arizona terrain with a volcanic terrain filled with ashes, lava and crystals.

Applicable to skirmish/multiplayer only; breaks other tilesets once loaded.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
