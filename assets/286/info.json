    "description": "Hello Gentlemen,\n\nThe map is called Little Mob, because there is, a little mob.. of the trees on it.\n\nThe map is for four players. 65x65 so very small. 5 oils per player, and one extra oil in the very centre. Advanced basic bases included. I shall remain silent about the existence of the gateways soon.\n\nHave fun,\n\nRegards,\n\nMero",
