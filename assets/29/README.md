## Description:

This mod replaces Arizona terrain with some sort of paradise terrain of sunny green grass, beaches palm trees. 

Applicable to skirmish/multiplayer only.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
