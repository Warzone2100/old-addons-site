## Description:

-----PLEASE NOTE--------

Unfortunately this mod is too large to host in the addons section, please download at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/artrev2100/files/latest/download

-----PLEASE NOTE--------

The goal of this mod is to recreate all the graphical assets in high detail, using dynamic lighting and normal & specular mapping.

While we may take a few artistic liberties, we try to stay as true to the original style as possible, so you should be able to recognize the tanks & weapons.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
