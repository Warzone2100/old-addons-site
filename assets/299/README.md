## Description:

TO USE THIS MOD IN SKIRMISH:

Download the "EB.wz" attachment and place it in the folder:

/Path/To/Warzone Installation/mods/global/

Then start WZ with --mod=EB.wz

Like this:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Warzone 2100-3.2.1\ warzone2100.exe" --mod=EB.wz

TO USE THIS MOD IN MULTIPLAYER:

Download the "EB.wz" attachment and open it like a folder. Inside EB there are 2 folders "stats" and "multiplay". Place these two folders inside any map.

MAIN HIGHLIGHTS:

1. The new medium power setting is now equivalent to the old high power setting. 

> Power Module 55 --> 80 power per minute (with 4 oils, no upgrades)

The high power setting now allows for a truly high power game if desired. Low and medium oil maps on the new high power setting have improved game play tactics. All power upgrades take 15% longer to research.

2. Every droid design and cyborg now has a unique speed signature and the engine upgrades make the droids move progressively faster. Currently, most droids already have the maximum speed allowed by default meaning the engine upgrades do not have any affect. Under improved balance, lighter bodies have a speed bonus over heavier bodies. Engine upgrades only affect newly produced units, not existing ones. Max speeds for all propulsion types are slightly increased.

Old max speed --> New max speed

VTOL 5.47 --> 7 tiles per second

Hover 2.34 --> 3

Wheel 1.37 --> 2

Half Track 1.17 --> 1.5

Track 0.98 --> 1.1

(Only scorpion, mantis, vengeance and light bodies top out at max speeds.)

Flamer = Fastest

Rockets/Missiles = Fast

MG/Laser = Medium

Cannon/Rail = Slow

Artillery = Slowest

 

3. Slightly rebalanced the Hit Point bonus for each propulsion:

Wheel 100% --> 135% (+35% HP)

Hover 100% --> 120% (+20% HP)

Track 300% --> 310% (+10% HP)

Half Track 200% --> 200% (+0% HP Unchanged)

Wheel Build Time 75% --> 25% (Builds faster)

VTOL Cost 150% --> 175% (Costs more) 

4. Red and black body performance have been improved:

Black bodies get:

+15% armor

+30% improved production times

Red bodies get:

+33% armor

+20% HP

+20% improved production times

Earlier arrival time

5. Restructured each of the 4 defense types (emplacement, bunker, tower, hardpoint) in distinguishing ways (HP, Range, DMG, Armor, Build Time) to improve value of structures vs droids.

Hardpoints get:

Build Time: 400 --> 800

Hitpoints: 800 --> 1200

Weapon Range: + 2 tiles

Damage: +0% (Unchanged)

Armor: 15 (Unchanged)

Towers get:

Build Time: 400 (Unchanged)

Hitpoints: 600 --> 700

Weapon Range: + 1.5 tiles

Damage: +10%

Armor: 15 (Unchanged)

Bunkers get:

Build Time: 400 --> 600

Hitpoints: 700 --> 800

Weapon Range: + 1 tile

Damage: +20%

Armor: 20 --> 28

Emplacements get:

Build Time: 400 -> |200 - 350| (varies)

Hitpoints: 400 (Unchanged)

Weapon Range: + 1 tile

Damage: +30%

Armor: 10 (Unchanged)

Note: Does not apply to AA, Mortar, Howitzer structures. Enabled twin mg bunker. Construction rates for trucks are improved at end of game

6. Added new "Guarded oil derrick" that has MG turret. Automatically available after MG tower is finished.

7. Research costs were originally determined by research points/32 and capped at 450 max cost (14400 research points). 

New research costs are:

Default: Research points/26 (Slightly more expensive)

Weapons: Research points/20 (More expensive)

Bodies: Research points/13 (More than twice as expensive)

All prices rounded off to nearest 5 (e.g.: 5, 10, 15, 20). Overall, research prices range from 25 (beginning) - ~1200 (end).

8. Generally speaking, the tech tree researches slightly slower before scourge and slightly faster afterwards. The end of tech tree is more compact. The 8 – 12 minute upgrades at the end now take 4 – 6 minutes. Many turret and body arrival times were readjusted within 1 – 2 minutes to improve effectiveness.

9. VTOL and Artillery research paths are available earlier but each item takes 10 – 20% longer. Mortar arrives after sensor tower (much earlier) and VTOL’s arrive ~90 seconds earlier. The stats for each VTOL/Artillery weapon were tweaked to ensure each weapon is progressively better with a time window of effectiveness. (Currently all players just wait for HEAP bomb and Ground Shaker.)

Cluster --> Phosphor --> HEAP --> Thermite --> Plasmite

Howitzer --> Incendiary Howitzer --> Groundshaker --> Hellstorm

Groundshaker arrives ~6 minutes later

HEAP Bomb arrives ~4 minutes later

Non-bomb VTOL's arrive earlier with improved performance and also early AA Flak Cannon and Sunburst improved performance.

10. Lasers now do incendiary damage and use the flamer damage profile (but still upgraded by lasers). This means heavy and pulse laser are effective vs all droids and most structures but very bad vs HARD structures. Very effective vs bunkers. Does not apply to flashlight, flashlight still anti-personnel. Laser is now an alternative to missile and rail instead of a supplement.

11. Repair rates for mobile droids improved. Heavy repair turret now arrives directly after light repair turret. Before it arrived mid-game and was not effective. Repair center now requires heavy repair turret instead of factory module. So research for repair goes:

Engineering --> Mobile repair turret --> Heavy repair turret --> Repair center

12. The beginning of the tech tree is much more strategical (see screenshot):

The engine upgrade was added to the beginning of the tech tree meaning there are 4 choices to choose from. Each route takes slightly longer but offers a big upgrade, a structure and a weapon:

***Truck***

Cost: 100

Research Time: 2 minutes

Upgrade: +50% Construction Rate

Structure: Cyborg Factory

Weapon: Flamer

***Engine***

Cost: 100

Research Time: 2 minutes

Upgrade: +30% Unit Speed

Structure: Power Module

Weapon: Mini-Pod

***Sensor***

Cost: 100

Research Time: 2 minutes

Upgrade: +300% Sensor Range

Structure: Research module

Weapon: Mortar (arrives after sensor tower)

***MG***

Cost: 25

Research Time: 0:42 (Unchanged)

Upgrade: +25% MG dmg (Unchanged)

Structure: Guarded Oil Derrick

Weapon: Cannon/MG

The purpose is to make the first research choice a strategic one.

13. Build times for base structures are slightly adjusted to make it harder to identify the most optimal sequence of base structures to build. 

research center 500 --> 600

factory 500 --> 450

power generator 500 --> 400

cyborg factory 500 --> 400

power module 250 --> 500

research module 250 --> 500

Cost of oil derrick 0 --> 25. 

This makes it harder to quickly accumulate research centers increasing the importance of the 1st research choice. 

14. Set the following weapons to HEAT damage profile instead of KINETIC damage:

KINETIC --> HEAT:

Tank Killer

Seraph

Arch Angel

Vindicator AA

Avenger AA

Sunburst AA

Needle

Rail

Gauss

HEAT weapons generally do 10% more damage than their kinetic counterparts. Near the end of the tech tree they are inferior to KINETIC weapons vs droids but still superior vs structures. Increases importance of thermal armor.

15. Changed names of certain cyborgs and sensor upgrades:

*Cyb-Wpn-Atmiss* --> MissileMan

*Cyborg Grenade Weapon* --> Grenadier

*Cyb-Wpn-Laser* --> Flash Sniper

*Cyb-Wpn-Rail1* --> NeedleMan

*Cyborg Thermite Weapon* --> Thermite Flamer

*CyborgRotMG* --> Assault Gunner

*Cyborg Mechanic* --> Mechanical Engineer

*Combat Engineer* --> Combat Engineer

Lancer Cyborg --> Rocketeer

Sensor Upgrade --> Infrared Sensor Upgrade

Sensor Upgrade Mk2 --> Ultraviolet Sensor Upgrade Mk2

Sensor Upgrade Mk3 --> Gamma Ray Sensor Upgrade Mk3

16. The last damage upgrade for all weapon lines is more effective:

R-Wpn-AAGun-Damage06 25% --> 45%

R-Wpn-Howitzer-Damage06 25% --> 45%

R-Wpn-Mortar-Damage06 25% --> 45%

R-Wpn-Cannon-Damage09 25% --> 45%

R-Wpn-Rocket-Damage09 25% --> 45%

R-Wpn-Flamer-Damage09 25% --> 45% (burn time 25% --> 55%)

R-Wpn-MG-Damage08 25% --> 35%

R-Wpn-Energy-Damage03 25% --> 50%

R-Wpn-Missile-Damage03 25% --> 50%

R-Wpn-Rail-Damage03 25% --> 25% (Untouched) 

17. There are many more minor performance improvements that don't fall under any of the categories above but are too difficult to explain and list here. Please consider adding feedback for using these stats in the next release.
