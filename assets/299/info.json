    "description": "TO USE THIS MOD IN SKIRMISH:\n\nDownload the \"EB.wz\" attachment and place it in the folder:\n/Path/To/Warzone Installation/mods/global/\n\nThen start WZ with --mod=EB.wz\n\nLike this:\n\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Warzone 2100-3.2.1\\ warzone2100.exe\" --mod=EB.wz\n\nTO USE THIS MOD IN MULTIPLAYER:\n\nDownload the \"EB.wz\" attachment and open it like a folder. Inside EB there are 2 folders \"stats\" and \"multiplay\". Place these two folders inside any map.\n\nMAIN HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n1. The new medium power setting is now equivalent to the old high power setting. \n\n\tPower Module 55 --> 80 power per minute (with 4 oils, no upgrades)\n\nThe high power setting now allows for a truly high power game if desired. Low and medium oil maps on the new high power setting have improved game play tactics. All power upgrades take 15% longer to research.\n\n2. Every droid design and cyborg now has a unique speed signature and the engine upgrades make the droids move progressively faster. Currently, most droids already have the maximum speed allowed by default meaning the engine upgrades do not have any affect. Under improved balance, lighter bodies have a speed bonus over heavier bodies. Engine upgrades only affect newly produced units, not existing ones. Max speeds for all propulsion types are slightly increased.\n\nOld max speed --> New max speed\n\nVTOL 5.47 --> 7 tiles per second\nHover 2.34 --> 3\nWheel 1.37 --> 2\nHalf Track 1.17 --> 1.5\nTrack 0.98 --> 1.1\n\n(Only scorpion, mantis, vengeance and light bodies top out at max speeds.)\n\nFlamer = Fastest\nRockets/Missiles = Fast\nMG/Laser = Medium\nCannon/Rail = Slow\nArtillery = Slowest\n \n3. Slightly rebalanced the Hit Point bonus for each propulsion:\n\nWheel 100% --> 135% (+35% HP)\nHover 100% --> 120% (+20% HP)\nTrack 300% --> 310% (+10% HP)\nHalf Track 200% --> 200% (+0% HP Unchanged)\n\nWheel Build Time 75% --> 25% (Builds faster)\nVTOL Cost 150% --> 175% (Costs more) \n\n4. Red and black body performance have been improved:\n\nBlack bodies get:\n+15% armor\n+30% improved production times\n\nRed bodies get:\n+33% armor\n+20% HP\n+20% improved production times\nEarlier arrival time\n\n5. Restructured each of the 4 defense types (emplacement, bunker, tower, hardpoint) in distinguishing ways (HP, Range, DMG, Armor, Build Time) to improve value of structures vs droids.\n\nHardpoints get:\nBuild Time: 400 --> 800\nHitpoints: 800 --> 1200\nWeapon Range: + 2 tiles\nDamage: +0% (Unchanged)\nArmor: 15 (Unchanged)\n\nTowers get:\nBuild Time: 400 (Unchanged)\nHitpoints: 600 --> 700\nWeapon Range: + 1.5 tiles\nDamage: +10%\nArmor: 15 (Unchanged)\n\nBunkers get:\nBuild Time: 400 --> 600\nHitpoints: 700 --> 800\nWeapon Range: + 1 tile\nDamage: +20%\nArmor: 20 --> 28\n\nEmplacements get:\nBuild Time: 400 -> |200 - 350| (varies)\nHitpoints: 400 (Unchanged)\nWeapon Range: + 1 tile\nDamage: +30%\nArmor: 10 (Unchanged)\n\nNote: Does not apply to AA, Mortar, Howitzer structures. Enabled twin mg bunker. Construction rates for trucks are improved at end of game\n\n6. Added new \"Guarded oil derrick\" that has MG turret. Automatically available after MG tower is finished.\n\n7. Research costs were originally determined by research points/32 and capped at 450 max cost (14400 research points). \n\nNew research costs are:\n\nDefault: Research points/26 (Slightly more expensive)\nWeapons: Research points/20 (More expensive)\nBodies: Research points/13 (More than twice as expensive)\n\nAll prices rounded off to nearest 5 (e.g.: 5, 10, 15, 20). Overall, research prices range from 25 (beginning) - ~1200 (end).\n\n\n8. Generally speaking, the tech tree researches slightly slower before scourge and slightly faster afterwards. The end of tech tree is more compact. The 8 – 12 minute upgrades at the end now take 4 – 6 minutes. Many turret and body arrival times were readjusted within 1 – 2 minutes to improve effectiveness.\n\n9. VTOL and Artillery research paths are available earlier but each item takes 10 – 20% longer. Mortar arrives after sensor tower (much earlier) and VTOL’s arrive ~90 seconds earlier. The stats for each VTOL/Artillery weapon were tweaked to ensure each weapon is progressively better with a time window of effectiveness. (Currently all players just wait for HEAP bomb and Ground Shaker.)\n\nCluster --> Phosphor --> HEAP --> Thermite --> Plasmite\nHowitzer --> Incendiary Howitzer --> Groundshaker --> Hellstorm\nGroundshaker arrives ~6 minutes later\nHEAP Bomb arrives ~4 minutes later\n\nNon-bomb VTOL's arrive earlier with improved performance and also early AA Flak Cannon and Sunburst improved performance.\n\n10. Lasers now do incendiary damage and use the flamer damage profile (but still upgraded by lasers). This means heavy and pulse laser are effective vs all droids and most structures but very bad vs HARD structures. Very effective vs bunkers. Does not apply to flashlight, flashlight still anti-personnel. Laser is now an alternative to missile and rail instead of a supplement.\n\n11. Repair rates for mobile droids improved. Heavy repair turret now arrives directly after light repair turret. Before it arrived mid-game and was not effective. Repair center now requires heavy repair turret instead of factory module. So research for repair goes:\n\nEngineering --> Mobile repair turret --> Heavy repair turret --> Repair center\n\n12. The beginning of the tech tree is much more strategical (see screenshot):\nThe engine upgrade was added to the beginning of the tech tree meaning there are 4 choices to choose from. Each route takes slightly longer but offers a big upgrade, a structure and a weapon:\n\n***Truck***\nCost: 100\nResearch Time: 2 minutes\nUpgrade: +50% Construction Rate\nStructure: Cyborg Factory\nWeapon: Flamer\n\n***Engine***\nCost: 100\nResearch Time: 2 minutes\nUpgrade: +30% Unit Speed\nStructure: Power Module\nWeapon: Mini-Pod\n\n***Sensor***\nCost: 100\nResearch Time: 2 minutes\nUpgrade: +300% Sensor Range\nStructure: Research module\nWeapon: Mortar (arrives after sensor tower)\n\n***MG***\nCost: 25\nResearch Time: 0:42 (Unchanged)\nUpgrade: +25% MG dmg (Unchanged)\nStructure: Guarded Oil Derrick\nWeapon: Cannon/MG\n\nThe purpose is to make the first research choice a strategic one.\n\n13. Build times for base structures are slightly adjusted to make it harder to identify the most optimal sequence of base structures to build. \n\nresearch center 500 --> 600\nfactory 500 --> 450\npower generator 500 --> 400\ncyborg factory 500 --> 400\npower module 250 --> 500\nresearch module 250 --> 500\n\nCost of oil derrick 0 --> 25. \n\nThis makes it harder to quickly accumulate research centers increasing the importance of the 1st research choice. \n\n14. Set the following weapons to HEAT damage profile instead of KINETIC damage:\n\nKINETIC --> HEAT:\n\nTank Killer\nSeraph\nArch Angel\nVindicator AA\nAvenger AA\nSunburst AA\nNeedle\nRail\nGauss\n\nHEAT weapons generally do 10% more damage than their kinetic counterparts. Near the end of the tech tree they are inferior to KINETIC weapons vs droids but still superior vs structures. Increases importance of thermal armor.\n\n15. Changed names of certain cyborgs and sensor upgrades:\n\n*Cyb-Wpn-Atmiss* --> MissileMan\n*Cyborg Grenade Weapon* --> Grenadier\n*Cyb-Wpn-Laser* --> Flash Sniper\n*Cyb-Wpn-Rail1* --> NeedleMan\n*Cyborg Thermite Weapon* --> Thermite Flamer\n*CyborgRotMG* --> Assault Gunner\n*Cyborg Mechanic* --> Mechanical Engineer\n*Combat Engineer* --> Combat Engineer\nLancer Cyborg --> Rocketeer\n\nSensor Upgrade --> Infrared Sensor Upgrade\nSensor Upgrade Mk2 --> Ultraviolet Sensor Upgrade Mk2\nSensor Upgrade Mk3 --> Gamma Ray Sensor Upgrade Mk3\n\n16. The last damage upgrade for all weapon lines is more effective:\nR-Wpn-AAGun-Damage06 25% --> 45%\nR-Wpn-Howitzer-Damage06 25% --> 45%\nR-Wpn-Mortar-Damage06 25% --> 45%\n\nR-Wpn-Cannon-Damage09 25% --> 45%\nR-Wpn-Rocket-Damage09 25% --> 45%\nR-Wpn-Flamer-Damage09 25% --> 45% (burn time 25% --> 55%)\n\nR-Wpn-MG-Damage08 25% --> 35%\n\nR-Wpn-Energy-Damage03 25% --> 50%\nR-Wpn-Missile-Damage03 25% --> 50%\nR-Wpn-Rail-Damage03 25% --> 25% (Untouched) \n\n\n17. There are many more minor performance improvements that don't fall under any of the categories above but are too difficult to explain and list here. Please consider adding feedback for using these stats in the next release.\n\n\n",
