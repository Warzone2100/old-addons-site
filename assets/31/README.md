## Description:

A 3x3 team duel map with custom textures similar to the paradise tileset mod, but with a little more extra eye candy to notice.

Each team consists of a fortress for two players with 4 oils each and a standalone highground position for a single player with 6 oils.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
