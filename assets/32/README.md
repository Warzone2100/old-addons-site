## Description:

A 4-player map with customized road textures.

The map is a large free-for-all. Even though the middle hill doesn't have any oil, the oils around it are bound to be an object of interest, and it seems impossible to protect them with a single army; thus army placement needs to be considered carefully on this map.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
