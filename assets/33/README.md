## Description:

A 4-player map with customized road textures. 

This is a simple free-for-all map with well-defended starting positions and large scavenger base at the middle.

[^1]: This archived mod is only tested with this older version of Warzone 2100, and is unlikely to work with more modern versions as-is.
