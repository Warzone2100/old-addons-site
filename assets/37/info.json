    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nAfter a longer time I have decided to create yet another NTW variation of mine. So as always I am both hated and loved?  now  \n\nIt has subtitle Scav due to the fact that it is overwhelmed by the scavengers. This clever nation not only took four slots of eight player map, but reduced the walls dividing them and used it to elevate ground in front of their bases to make it easier for them to defend. Experienced engineers of theirs have found extra oil for them too. As a result they defended heavily, built a lot of houses and necessary structures. \n\nThe map is 200x180 for 4 players. Advanced bases and gateways are included. Be warned that you have only 7 oils in base. The entire rest, in amount of eight per player, is being kept by the Scavengers at the entire area of their bases. To sum up, 32 oils is being kept by the both bases of the Scavengers. (15 oils per player) Those are heavily protected, and to get all of their oil, it is necessary to execute every one of them, and every structure. Even if you happily capture the oil in front of their bases, yellow mass will find you sooner or later. \n\nThe line of hills going through the centre is to make it both easier and harder to defend for players between themselves. But remember that there is nothing that helps you to defend from the opposite Scavengers bases.\n\nThe players bases have basic defences and few basic structures including the repair facility.\n\nHave fun gentlemen  One have never been so close to the Scavengers on a NTW map before  \n\nMero, RekamPam\n",
