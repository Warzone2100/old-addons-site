## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

After quite a big pause I am happy to present the Ghost City map  

It is this time urban The map is called Ghost City because almost entire map is a post nuclear ghost city with some facilities at the top of the mountain which purpose is not even known to the oldest scavengers.

The map is 190x190 for four players. Advanced bases, which are spread on bigger areas including canyons and hills are included. Gateways and Scavengers are included too.

The map is 15 oils per player. You have 5 oils in base, ten around the map, one of which is hold by scavengers. Have it on mind that three of your five oils is spread around in what I call "a base"

Bases are so designed to make you feel safe. You have one thin ground road to it, but very wide by hovers. You can also locate your buildings wisely on both of your hills. When you turn on advanced bases you will notice that there are few inner defence systems including some concrete, to hold as long as possible to persistent  enemy attack. Precious time can save you, but dont have to.

Do not underestimate the thin passages on the water, especially when enemy will capture the strange area at the top of the mountain. But at the same time you can be shot from the bases if the enemy is well prepared.

It is a city, so there is a lot of buildings. Also visit many places to be nicely rewarded.

Have fun  

It is so great to feel the relief of creating something finally
