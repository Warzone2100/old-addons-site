    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nI was asked here and also via PM message to bring the ships closer to each other so artillery from both ships could shot at each other. So here are the Ships without the island.\n\n\nI think there is no need to explain why the map has this particular name  \n\nThe map is for 4 players. 170x200, but in fact it is not so big as you are limited to building only on the ships, or on the island in the centre. There is 8 oils on each ship. There are two trucks on the both big ships. And there is an extra tanker ship for each player with no trucks on it, and those tanker ships can only be accessed by VTOL transport. All the big ships have ramps, so hovers can be sent from them to other ships. Advanced bases are included, including gateways and repair centres. To sum up there is 16 oil per player. Additional 4 on the tanker ships. \n\nThe ships look really nice, and give at least very small idea of the idea of being on a war ship  \n\n!!!text!!!\nThe map requires usage of hovers or VTOLs to successfully finish it.\n\nHave great fun on the battleships  \n\nRegards,\n\nMero, RekamPam\n",
