## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

Eagle Eyes need really good sight, or shall I see eagle eyes on a minimap, and moving the camera around the map to maintain without bad mistakes.

The map is designrd in such a way that if a player seem to have better base possition, there is a drawback because of that. If something seem to be better due to any cause, there is a consequence connected to that. Cause and effect  

The map is for four players, 200 x 200. 33 oils per player, but nine of it is being hold by the scavengers. Some of the oil is placed on islands. It can be for any type of a game even FAA, or 3 v 1. As mentioned above the Scavengers are included. Also advanced bases with basic defences and gateways. There is five trucks per player. The rule is, two of the tracks are next to the base number. The remining tree are placed in the three remining base places on the map. One in each base "corner" It allows you to maintain correctly all four places of your base on the map. If needed I can make low oil version of the map. Visiting mysterious places is always advisable  

Have fun
