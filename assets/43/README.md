## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

I do like to surprise, as I do like to create things that Warzone has never seen so far  

As a result I break some convenanses here but I do hope not with a bad effect.

Gentlemen I am very happy to present The Battle Ships map  

I think there is no need to explain why the map has this particular name  

The map is for 4 players. 200x200, but in fact it is not so big as you are limited to building only on the ships, or on the island in the centre. There is 8 oils on each ship. There are two trucks on the both big ships. And there is an extra tanker ship for each player with no trucks on it, and those tanker ships can only be accessed by VTOL transport. All the big ships have ramps, so hovers can be sent from them to other ships, or on the island. Advanced bases are included, including gateways and repair centres. To sum up there is 16 oil per player. Additional 4 on the tanker ship. And there is six oils on the island.

On the island there are scavengers located in a way that allows, at least for a moment  land successfully on the island before being attacked.

The ships look really nice, and give at least very small idea of the idea of being on a war ship  

!!!text!!!

The map requires usage of hovers or VTOLs to successfully finish it.

Have great fun on the first battleships  

Regards,

Mero, RekamPam
