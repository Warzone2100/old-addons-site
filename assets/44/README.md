## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

The Simplicity map, is intended to be very simple, especially in terms of terrain. But it is you who will decide about that  

The bases are located very near to each other and moved toward centre, which makes it very easier to be attacked from any side. You have to not only manage within the base, but also protect your base from every side especially when advanced bases are turned on. Each base has two external outposts, use them wisely  

The map is for eight players, and can be used for extreme FAA. It is 200x200. 22 oils per player, 8 oils is located in base, or shall I say near the trucks when the advanced bases are off. The rest is located both in front and behind the bases, and near its outside corners. Advanced bases are included. Each base is double walled and has four entrances. Each base is protected by machinegun guard towers and Vindicator SAM 2 AA sites. Gateways are included.

When you will start a game with no advanced bases, it trains a lot of management skills as you are basically protected by nothing.

Have fun  

Regards,

Mero, RekamPam
