    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nHypnosis owns its name due to the fact that it reminds me of this spinning device used sometimes for hypnosis  \n\nThe map is for eight players. 14 oils per player, but two of those oils are available only by VTOL Transport, so it will be mainly 12 per player I assume  \n\nAdvanced very basic bases are included with a little defence system. Gateways are included. The map is 180x180\n\nThe map can be unpredictable sometimes as the enemy forces can appear from both sides of each base. Also hovers add some advantage.\n\nHave fun gentlemen  \n",
