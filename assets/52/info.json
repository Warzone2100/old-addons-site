    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nA modest come back  Moonlit Squared is simply modified Sunny Squared, I wanted to make separate map with two ways to a base, but finally looking at my draws I decided to modify the previous map.\n\nThe map is for eight players, twenty four oils per player in base and another three per player on the cliffs. Advanced bases with the simplest defences and gateways are included.\n\nEnjoy more safe base ways  \n",
