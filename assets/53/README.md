## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

And back on track again  

The map is called as it is called because..  simply look at the preview   

But do not underestimate it, the goo, it! It gives at least one interesting tactic possibility if battled wisely  

The map is 180x180, for four players but no scavengers included. Advanced bases and gateways are implemented. It is 19 oil per player, six in base.

Have fun! 

Damn I love what I do
