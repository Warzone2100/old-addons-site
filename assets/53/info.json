    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nAnd back on track again  \n\nThe map is called as it is called because..  simply look at the preview   \n\nBut do not underestimate it, the goo, it! It gives at least one interesting tactic possibility if battled wisely  \n\nThe map is 180x180, for four players but no scavengers included. Advanced bases and gateways are implemented. It is 19 oil per player, six in base.\n\nHave fun! \n\nDamn I love what I do  \n",
