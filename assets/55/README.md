## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

The map is called Tactical SQR because of few tactical options you can chose to use while playing it. It is the same as Fierce SQR with the two major differences  

The first one is that the area outside the Squared Area is now accessible from back of each base, so as a result there are now two entrances to each base.

The second one is that the oil amount was reduced to 18 in base per player, and another five per player outside of the bases.

You can climb and build on every cliff around and within your base and you can built secondary bases outside the "Squared" area. The outside area has oil and many strategic points. At the corners of the map there is only one oil accessible only by hovercraft.

Possibility to climb the cliffs give new offence and defence possibilities. You can even partly affect the centre from the safe place of the cliffs which belong to your base. The oil is spread so it is not so easy to get quickly all of it.

The map is 220x220, for eight players. 18 oils in base, by base I mean entire area of one's base, so it takes some time to collect it. there is 5 extra oils per player outside the squared area. Advanced bases are included and gateways are included. Visiting the highest cliffs at the centre, or the outside squared area will be rewarded in few precious oil barrels  

If you happen to like the map I can make the oil amount even smaller in accordance to your wishes.

Have fun Gentlemen
