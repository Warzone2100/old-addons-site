## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

We can high generate thousands of pictures, we can rotate thousands of shapes, we still have endless possibility of creation here, what deeply fascinate me  the more we create, the better for us, for the community, for Warzone 2100 fans, lovers, guests  

Now high generate and rotate my creativity    

I am extremely happy to present my water squared  

The map is Squared, yes simply Squared, with this difference that it is almost entirely made of water  All general layout is the same, but the upper level, even the cliffs, and the areas near the bases are filled with water!!!  

It is quite an unusual experience to see our old beloved (by some  ) Squared, entirely filled with water. It makes impression at least at the very beginning.

The map is 200x200, but the exact ground area, the terrain one, is much smaller, as a result you build in 40x40 squares, surrounded by water.

Placing water in the way I did adds new tactics to the game, and stops to some degree ultra turtling. Do not worry, there is enough space to build anything you wish.

The map is for 8 players, advanced bases are included with basic defences. All you could wish is fully equipped in the terms of structures. There is 30 oils per player, if you wish I can decrease the amount, increase it  or spread around  All of the oil is in the base. Gateways are included.

Have fun Gentlemen, I hope I have brought something new, due to some things the map was hell to be made  

Enjoy
