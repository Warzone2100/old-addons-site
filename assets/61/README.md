## Description:

The NTW Queen and NTW King have a boy :) he is yet so very young, so they made him a toy!

A NTW map which is a small Box, made exactly of 3364 of tileset blocks..

The one who will say the map size right, is redy I assure you to begin the fight!

Be redy and be quick! the maps size is sick!

In fact, to some degree, you build in enemys base, so do it faster than is your foes pace.

Make every move right, prepare for the fight!

Its not simply a toy, said the litle boy!

Enemy will die! and the lost will cry!

The map is for eight players. The map size is (a square of 3364 tiles, which is? how many? x how many?) :lecture: Advanced bases included. Two trucks, and five oils per player in base. No scavengers as it would be insane :lecture: Gateways included.

I am warning you the map is extremely small :lecture: and yes my fellow mapmaker inspired me with this by his work :3

Have Fun :)

And don't get claustrophobic :)
