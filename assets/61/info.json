    "description": "The NTW Queen and NTW King have a boy :) he is yet so very young, so they made him a toy!\n\nA NTW map which is a small Box, made exactly of 3364 of tileset blocks..\n\nThe one who will say the map size right, is redy I assure you to begin the fight!\n\nBe redy and be quick! the maps size is sick!\n\nIn fact, to some degree, you build in enemys base, so do it faster than is your foes pace.\n\nMake every move right, prepare for the fight!\n\nIts not simply a toy, said the litle boy!\n\nEnemy will die! and the lost will cry!\n\n\nThe map is for eight players. The map size is (a square of 3364 tiles, which is? how many? x how many?) :lecture: Advanced bases included. Two trucks, and five oils per player in base. No scavengers as it would be insane :lecture: Gateways included.\n\nI am warning you the map is extremely small :lecture: and yes my fellow mapmaker inspired me with this by his work :3\n\nHave Fun :)\n\nAnd don't get claustrophobic :)",
