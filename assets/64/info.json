    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nOk let me begin in other way  \n\nGood afternoon Europe, good morning America  \n\nThe map is Called Mini SQR because it is Squared, but mini!  \n\nI have some nice ideas about varyin Squared style, so now I will use this SQR abbreviation for Squared maps It will only indicate the style of the map, the precidining name may be of any kind  \n\nThe map is really small because 120x120, I didn't want make it smaller because it would kill all mechanisms of the original one. As this is Squared, but much smaller, it has some mechanisms of the original one, but also few other not available there. There is 12 oils in base. Advanced bases are included, with basic defence structures to at least slow down ultra rusch possible on this map. Gateways are included.\n\nThere is also something interesting at the top of the cliffs, in the abandoned factories areas, but on this map it is not so likely to get enough time to research and built VTOLs, but yet not so hard.\n\nThe map is very small so a sort of gentlemen agreement may be needed that we do not simply rush into each others base..\n\nHave Fun.  \n",
