## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

I am happy to present my Fishes map  I think it is a first of my maps on which an animal is clearly visible  or shall I say both animal and its skeleton  I wanted something with sharp edges and here it is  

It is 200x200, for 4 players, 4 oils in base, and another 11 per player on the map. Advanced bases included. Gateways included. And the fishes, the big ones, the skeleton ones, have The Scavengers on mind  I mean scavengers included  

It is very open, but bases are nicely protected by cliffs, and there are few other places not extremely open. Enemy bases can be accessed by wheeled units too. Each little fish has an oil pearl for you  

Have fun Gentlemen  and beware of fishbones.
