## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

It is the smallest map in my history here  

It is 64x64 and I think I do not need to explain its name now here  

The map is for 4 players. A typical rush map. 7 oils per player, I think it is the smallest oil number per player I have ever made too  Gentlemen am I evolving?  Advanced bases are included and gateways are included as well.

Have quick fun
