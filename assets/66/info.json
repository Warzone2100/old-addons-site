    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nIt is the smallest map in my history here  \n\nIt is 64x64 and I think I do not need to explain its name now here  \n\nThe map is for 4 players. A typical rush map. 7 oils per player, I think it is the smallest oil number per player I have ever made too  Gentlemen am I evolving?  Advanced bases are included and gateways are included as well.\n\nHave quick fun  \n",
