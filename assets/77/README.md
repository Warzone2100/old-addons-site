## Description:

Hello Gentlemen  

It took me ages but finally I got to FlaMe  

The map is called Meteors as its entire surface is filled with craters and remainings after the meteor storm.

The map is 200x200, for eight players, advanced bases included, gateways included, it is 12 oils per player. 4 oils in base.

It has nice texturing, I did my best to create environment which would look like after storm of meteors. The bases are protected only by few machinegun towers, and I wanted them to look like embankments of earth and concrete. Some even cover remaining craters partly  

What I am the most proud of is that it is not flat, and has multiple tricky ways both near the bases and near the drying river too  

Have fun gentlemen
