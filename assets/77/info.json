    "description": "Hello Gentlemen  \n\nIt took me ages but finally I got to FlaMe  \n\nThe map is called Meteors as its entire surface is filled with craters and remainings after the meteor storm.\n\nThe map is 200x200, for eight players, advanced bases included, gateways included, it is 12 oils per player. 4 oils in base.\n\nIt has nice texturing, I did my best to create environment which would look like after storm of meteors. The bases are protected only by few machinegun towers, and I wanted them to look like embankments of earth and concrete. Some even cover remaining craters partly  \n\nWhat I am the most proud of is that it is not flat, and has multiple tricky ways both near the bases and near the drying river too  \n\nHave fun gentlemen  \n",
